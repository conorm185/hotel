# hotel
This is the description for the final project in CSCI 2006. This website is a hotel service that accepts guests who check in and those who check out.

1. There will be a home page that will greet guests and tell them a little bit about the hotel
2. There will be three other pages in the website. One to determine what the users want, another where reviews are displayed from a database, and another one where contact information is displayed as well as other locations for the hotel service
3. The website will ask the user how many nights they would like to stay, what type of room they would like and if they would like any other services. Arrays and the POST Superglobal array will be used for this. Displayed in a table if necessary
4. A database will be constructed to work with the reviews that the users leave behind
5. The website will have necessary interactivity
