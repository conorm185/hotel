	<h1>History of Hotel Armitage</h1>
	</div>
		<div id="historyBox">
		<p>Hotel Armitage opened in 1907 within New York City. It was one of the first major luxury hotels that promised an
		experience that even the greatest events at the time couldn't top. Over the many decades of operation, Armitage
		expanded in the ways it could present its luxury and many from all over the world have come to witness it with
		their own eyes. Open to both tourists and many more, Hotel Armitage is something that will not be forgotten.
